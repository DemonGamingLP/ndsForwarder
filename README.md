# NDSForwarder

DSiWare Template downloaded from http://olmectron.github.io/forwarders/sdcard.(fwd|nds). Thanks to Olmectron for providing templates via their website.

Thanks to Martin Korth for GBATek, which provided pretty much all the information needed about the nds and dsi formats.

Thanks to 3DSGuy and everyone else who contributed to CTR Toolkit (of which, make_cia which is used in Olmectron's forwarder3ds app)

Thanks to RocketRobz and the DS-Homebrew team for all the nds-bootstrap and TWiLightMenu++ stuff. 

Thanks to Oreo639, Piepie62, Fenrir, and everyone else who helped me in my development career.

Thanks to lifehackerhansol for helping me test

Finally, thanks to the DevKitPro team for the toolchain (wintermute et al). Without that, homebrew just wouldn't be a thing.


Anyone else that I forgot to list, it's not you, it's me. Thank you. My progress is a product of the community and all it gives back. Thank everyone for being a part of it and helping.
